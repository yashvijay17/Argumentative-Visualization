<h4> Pretext </h4>
<p>
English premier league is one of the most famous Soccer football leagues all over the world. It's know for its competitive soccer, world class players, history, physical nature and the amount of money invested in all the teams.
<br><br>
Manchester United and Liverpool are one of the fiercest rivals in the league and being a United fan, I am well inclined towards the fact that Liverpool are not the greatest side at their home stadium.<br><br>
I try to prove my point with the help of above two charts. 
</p>

<h4> Left Chart </h4>
<p>
The chart on the left highlights the ongoing debate and public opinion that Liverpool have been amazing at home with their unbeaten record being world class. I have only portrayed their
loss vs. rest of the results in one chart. This highlights the fact that Liverpool have been incredibly successful due to their high unbeaten rate at home. (As is the public opinion)
</p>

<h4> Right Chart </h4>
<p>
      In the right chart, I have shown the proper breakdown match results which highlight the fact that Liverpool have had a lot of drawn matches too, that means that teams have come to the Anfield
      (Liverpools stadium) and have been able to go away with some points, thus, proving them to be not so formidable at home.
